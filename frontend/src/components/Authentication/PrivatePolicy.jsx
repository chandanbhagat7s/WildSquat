        <div className="indent-4">
          You can return items within 5 days of receiving your order. To be
          eligible for a return, your item must:
        </div>
        <li>Be unused, unwashed, and in the same condition as received.</li>
        <li>
          Include the original tags, packaging, and any accessories that came

        </li>
        <b>Non-Returnable Items:</b>
        <li>
          Certain items, such as underwear, sale items, or gift cards, are not
          eligible for return due to hygiene and clearance policies.
        </li>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">2. Exchanges</h3>
        <p className="indent-4">
          We offer exchanges for different sizes or colors of the same product,
          subject to availability. If the desired item is unavailable, we will
          process a refund. To start an exchange, follow the return process and
          specify the exchange request in your email to customer support.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">3. Refunds</h3>
        <p className="indent-4">
          Once we receive and inspect your return, we will notify you of its
          status. Approved returns will be refunded to your original payment
          method within 7-10 business days. Shipping costs are non-refundable,
          and any return shipping fees will be deducted from your refund, unless
          the return is due to a defect or error on our part.

          Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer, except
          in cases of damaged, defective, or incorrect items. We recommend using
